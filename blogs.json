        "The challenges of the climate crisis are changes in rain patterns, timetable and intensity. Hailstorms and floods have been severe. Droughts have also frequently not solved the needs of the crop cycle life, irrigation would have been the mitigation factor but most farmers are poor yet at times the water levels have drifted low.",
        "During heavy rains, water is sudden and could have been responsible for declining soil fertility because of the leaching of soil nutrients.",
        "Application of chemical fertilizers are subject to leaching during heavy downpour or it may be in the soil but not accessible by plant roots due to the dry period which leads to no moisture in the soil to move nutrients to the soil solution for plant uptake, hence no photosynthesis takes place. Due to changes in climate conditions, plants are stressed and susceptible to infestation by pests and diseases.",

A 500 ml bottle will cost 50,000 ugx, it is mixed at the ratio of 1 litre / …Some farmers have expressed poor germination and we have a solution to such an issue. For example if rice seeds are soaked in the liquid solution that we mix, the sprouting results will be at a very high rate. The solution can be applied as a soil drench (making something extremely wet) or foliage applied.",

        "I could say that it is better to get a yield penalty but reconsider your input costs plus profit. For further information, we can share if you face challenges and I will be of help."

          "p": "Today’s farmers face numerous obstacles that impact productivity and sustainability. Declining soil fertility is a significant issue. Over-reliance on chemical fertilizers and poor farming practices have depleted essential nutrients from the soil, making it less fertile and productive over time. Additionally, land fragmentation, resulting from population growth and urban expansion, has led to smaller, less productive farms. Environmental degradation, including soil erosion and nutrient leaching, further exacerbates the problem. These processes diminish the soil’s organic matter, which is crucial for healthy crop growth, resulting in lower yields despite increased fertilizer use."

          "h2": "The Benefits of Organic Matter",
          "p": "Soil rich in organic matter is vital for healthy crops. However, building up organic matter takes time and resources that many farmers lack. Our research at Mbale Ecological Farm has led to quick, effective solutions that provide immediate benefits without compromising long-term soil health. Our liquid fertilizer offers a balanced mix of macro and micronutrients, including trace elements, making it ideal for all crops. Whether you are a conventional or organic farmer, Agriguard products can seamlessly integrate into your farming practices."
