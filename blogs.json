        "<p class='text-base leading-7'>The world population has been consistently increasing meaning the demand for food is more challenging than ever before. The challenge has been necessitated by climate change, declining soil fertility and increasing pests and diseases.</p>",
        "<p class='text-base leading-7'>The challenges of the climate crisis are changes in rain patterns, timetable and intensity. Hailstorms and floods have been severe. Droughts have also frequently not solved the needs of the crop cycle life, irrigation would have been the mitigation factor but most farmers are poor yet at times the water levels have drifted low.</p>",
        "<p class='text-base leading-7'>During heavy rains, water is sudden and could have been responsible for declining soil fertility because of the leaching of soil nutrients.</p>",
        "<p class='text-base leading-7'>Application of chemical fertilizers are subject to leaching during heavy downpour or it may be in the soil but not accessible by plant roots due to the dry period which leads to no moisture in the soil to move nutrients to the soil solution for plant uptake, hence no photosynthesis takes place. Due to changes in climate conditions, plants are stressed and susceptible to infestation by pests and diseases.</p>",
        "<p class='text-base leading-7'>In order to address the above, we have come up with liquid fertilizers that can address the above issues and it is a local solution which may address the issues.</p>",
        "<p class='text-base leading-7'>You need only 500 ml for 2 acres, depending on the availability of the ingredients for making the same at the cost. A 500 ml bottle will cost 50,000 ugx, it is mixed at the ratio of 1 litre / …Some farmers have expressed poor germination and we have a solution to such an issue. For example if rice seeds are soaked in the liquid solution that we mix, the sprouting results will be at a very high rate. The solution can be applied as a soil drench (making something extremely wet) or foliage applied.</p>",
        "<p class='text-base leading-7'>Dilute 1 ml / 1 litre and foliage applied on the leaves (including the underside of the leaf). If soil is applied, then wet the soil first (after rains) and drench in the stem then cover around the stem with mulch.</p>",
        "<p class='text-base leading-7'>It is a general purpose fertilizer across all the crops and the customized brand can be made to address the needs of the specific crops. You may also use the solution to enrich your compost before applying it to plants.</p>",
        "<p class='text-base leading-7'>It is saddening to hear that farmers are spending are spending a lot of money on labour, fertilizers and pesticides yet the outputs are lower than the inputs.</p>",
        "<p class='text-base leading-7'>I could say that it is better to get a yield penalty but reconsider your input costs plus profit. For further information, we can share if you face challenges and I will be of help.</p>"

        "<h2 class='text-xl font-semibold leading-8 pb-2'>Understanding the Challenges in Modern Agriculture</h2>",
        "<p class='text-base leading-7'>Today’s farmers face numerous obstacles that impact productivity and sustainability. Declining soil fertility is a significant issue. Over-reliance on chemical fertilizers and poor farming practices have depleted essential nutrients from the soil, making it less fertile and productive over time. Additionally, land fragmentation, resulting from population growth and urban expansion, has led to smaller, less productive farms. Environmental degradation, including soil erosion and nutrient leaching, further exacerbates the problem. These processes diminish the soil’s organic matter, which is crucial for healthy crop growth, resulting in lower yields despite increased fertilizer use.</p>",
        "<h2 class='text-xl font-semibold leading-8 pb-2'>The Benefits of Organic Matter</h2>",
        "<p class='text-base leading-7'>Soil rich in organic matter is vital for healthy crops. However, building up organic matter takes time and resources that many farmers lack. Our research at Mbale Ecological Farm has led to quick, effective solutions that provide immediate benefits without compromising long-term soil health. Our liquid fertilizer offers a balanced mix of macro and micronutrients, including trace elements, making it ideal for all crops. Whether you are a conventional or organic farmer, Agriguard products can seamlessly integrate into your farming practices.</p>",
